                    // Question 1
                    {
                        question: "A trader marks his goods at 40% above the cost price and allows a discount of 25%. What is his gain percent?",
                        options: ["5%", "10%", "15%", "20%"],
                        answer: "5%",
                        rationale: "Let the cost price (CP) be 100. Marked Price (MP) = 100 + 40% of 100 = 140. Discount = 25% of 140 = 35. Selling Price (SP) = 140 - 35 = 105. Gain = SP - CP = 105 - 100 = 5. Gain % = (Gain/CP) * 100 = (5/100) * 100 = 5%."
                    },
                    // Question 2
                    {
                        question: "The compound interest on a certain sum for 2 years at 10% per annum is ₹525. The simple interest on the same sum for double the time at half the rate percent per annum is:",
                        options: ["₹400", "₹500", "₹600", "₹800"],
                        answer: "₹500",
                        rationale: "Let P be the principal. CI = P(1 + R/100)^T - P. 525 = P(1 + 10/100)^2 - P => 525 = P(1.1^2 - 1) => 525 = 0.21P => P = 525 / 0.21 = 2500. Now, SI = (P * R * T) / 100. New Time = 2*2 = 4 years. New Rate = 10/2 = 5%. SI = (2500 * 5 * 4) / 100 = ₹500."
                    },
                    // Question 3
                    {
                        question: "If 7 spiders make 7 webs in 7 days, then 1 spider will make 1 web in how many days?",
                        options: ["1 day", "7 days", "14 days", "49 days"],
                        answer: "7 days",
                        rationale: "This is a classic work and time problem. Use the formula (M1 * D1) / W1 = (M2 * D2) / W2. (7 spiders * 7 days) / 7 webs = (1 spider * D2) / 1 web. => 7 = D2. So, it takes 1 spider 7 days to make 1 web."
                    },

                    {
                        question: "A boat travels 20 km upstream in 5 hours and 30 km downstream in 3 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream.",
                        options: ["7 km/hr, 3 km/hr", "8 km/hr, 2 km/hr", "9 km/hr, 1 km/hr", "6 km/hr, 4 km/hr"],
                        answer: "7 km/hr, 3 km/hr",
                        rationale: "Upstream speed (u) = 20/5 = 4 km/hr. Downstream speed (d) = 30/3 = 10 km/hr. Speed of boat in still water (b) = (d + u) / 2 = (10 + 4) / 2 = 7 km/hr. Speed of stream (s) = (d - u) / 2 = (10 - 4) / 2 = 3 km/hr."

                    {
                        question: "The average of 5 consecutive odd numbers is 27. What is the largest of these numbers?",
                        options: ["29", "31", "33", "35"],
                        answer: "31",
                        rationale: "For consecutive numbers, the average is the middle number. So, the middle (3rd) odd number is 27. The 5 consecutive odd numbers are 23, 25, 27, 29, 31. The largest number is 31."
                    },

                        question: "A train 150 m long is running at 72 km/hr. In how much time will it pass a platform 250 m long?",
                        options: ["15 sec", "20 sec", "25 sec", "30 sec"],
                        answer: "20 sec",
                        rationale: "Total distance to be covered = Length of train + Length of platform = 150 + 250 = 400 m. Speed of train = 72 km/hr = 72 * (5/18) m/s = 20 m/s. Time = Distance / Speed = 400 / 20 = 20 seconds."
                    },
                    // Question 7
                    {
                        question: "If a:b = 5:7 and b:c = 6:11, then find a:b:c.",

                        answer: "30:42:77",
                        rationale: "To find a:b:c, we need to make the value of 'b' common in both ratios. a:b = 5:7 and b:c = 6:11. Multiply the first ratio by 6 and the second by 7. a:b = 30:42. b:c = 42:77. Therefore, a:b:c = 30:42:77."
                    },

                        options: ["1/4", "1/10", "7/15", "8/15"],
                        answer: "8/15",
                        rationale: "A's 1 day's work = 1/15. B's 1 day's work = 1/20. (A+B)'s 1 day's work = 1/15 + 1/20 = (4+3)/60 = 7/60. Work done in 4 days = 4 * (7/60) = 7/15. Remaining work = 1 - 7/15 = 8/15."

                        question: "The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. If 27 is added to the number, the digits get reversed. The number is:",
                        options: ["27", "63", "36", "45"],
                        answer: "36",
                        rationale: "Let the number be 10x + y. Given x+y=9 and 10x+y+27 = 10y+x. This simplifies to 9y - 9x = 27, or y - x = 3. Solving x+y=9 and y-x=3, we get 2y=12 => y=6 and x=3. The number is 36."
                    },
                    // Question 10
                    {
                        question: "The perimeter of a rectangular field is 480 meters and the ratio between the length and breadth is 5:3. The area of the field is:",
                        options: ["13500 sq.m", "12500 sq.m", "11500 sq.m", "10500 sq.m"],
                        answer: "13500 sq.m",
                        rationale: "Let length = 5x and breadth = 3x. Perimeter = 2(l+b) = 2(5x+3x) = 16x. 16x = 480 => x = 30. Length = 5*30 = 150 m. Breadth = 3*30 = 90 m. Area = l * b = 150 * 90 = 13500 sq.m."
                    },
                    { question: "If the radius of a sphere is increased by 50%, find the percentage increase in its surface area.", options: ["100%", "125%", "150%", "225%"], answer: "125%", rationale: "Let original radius be R. New radius R' = 1.5R. Original surface area A = 4πR². New surface area A' = 4π(1.5R)² = 4π(2.25R²) = 2.25 * A. Increase = A' - A = 1.25A. Percentage increase = (1.25A / A) * 100 = 125%." },
                    { question: "A mixture of 40 liters of milk and water contains 10% water. How much water must be added to make the water 20% in the new mixture?", options: ["5 liters", "6 liters", "8 liters", "10 liters"], answer: "5 liters", rationale: "Initial mixture: 40 liters. Water = 10% of 40 = 4L. Milk = 36L. Let x liters of water be added. New mixture = 40+x. New water = 4+x. We want (4+x)/(40+x) = 20/100 = 1/5. 5(4+x) = 40+x => 20+5x = 40+x => 4x = 20 => x=5 liters." },
                    { question: "Two pipes A and B can fill a tank in 20 and 30 minutes respectively. If both pipes are used together, then how long will it take to fill the tank?", options: ["12 min", "15 min", "25 min", "50 min"], answer: "12 min", rationale: "Work done by A in 1 min = 1/20. Work done by B in 1 min = 1/30. Work done by (A+B) in 1 min = 1/20 + 1/30 = (3+2)/60 = 5/60 = 1/12. So, both pipes together will fill the tank in 12 minutes." },
                    { question: "Find the value of log₂(log₃(81)).", options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"], answer: "2", rationale: "First, solve the inner logarithm: log₃(81). Since 3⁴ = 81, log₃(81) = 4. Now the expression is log₂(4). Since 2² = 4, log₂(4) = 2." },
                    { question: "A dishonest dealer professes to sell his goods at cost price but uses a weight of 960 gm for a kg weight. Find his gain percent.", options: ["4%", "4.16%", "4.25%", "5%"], answer: "4.16%", rationale: "The dealer gains the amount of goods he saves. Gain = (Error / (True Value - Error)) * 100. Error = 1000 - 960 = 40 gm. Gain % = (40 / 960) * 100 = (1/24) * 100 = 4.166...%." },
                    { question: "The HCF and LCM of two numbers are 12 and 336 respectively. If one of the numbers is 84, the other is:", options: ["36", "48", "72", "96"], answer: "48", rationale: "Product of two numbers = Product of their HCF and LCM. 84 * Other Number = 12 * 336. Other Number = (12 * 336) / 84 = 336 / 7 = 48." },
                    { question: "What is the probability of getting a sum of 9 from two throws of a dice?", options: ["1/6", "1/8", "1/9", "1/12"], answer: "1/9", rationale: "Total possible outcomes = 6 * 6 = 36. Favorable outcomes for a sum of 9 are (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3). There are 4 favorable outcomes. Probability = 4/36 = 1/9." },
                    { question: "The diagonal of a cube is 6√3 cm. Its volume is:", options: ["144 cm³", "216 cm³", "256 cm³", "180 cm³"], answer: "216 cm³", rationale: "Diagonal of a cube = a√3, where 'a' is the side. a√3 = 6√3 => a = 6 cm. Volume of a cube = a³ = 6³ = 216 cm³." },
                    { question: "A sum of money doubles itself in 8 years at simple interest. What is the rate of interest?", options: ["10%", "12.5%", "15%", "20%"], answer: "12.5%", rationale: "Let Principal = P. Amount = 2P. Interest = P. Time = 8 years. SI = (P*R*T)/100 => P = (P*R*8)/100 => 100 = 8R => R = 100/8 = 12.5%." },
                    { question: "If 15 men can do a work in 12 days, how many men will be required to do the same work in 18 days?", options: ["8 men", "10 men", "12 men", "15 men"], answer: "10 men", rationale: "Use the formula M1*D1 = M2*D2. 15 * 12 = M2 * 18. M2 = (15 * 12) / 18 = 15 * (2/3) = 10 men." },
                    { question: "A number when divided by 36 leaves a remainder of 23. What will be the remainder when the same number is divided by 9?", options: ["0", "5", "7", "Cannot be determined"], answer: "5", rationale: "Let the number be N. N = 36k + 23. Since 36 is divisible by 9, we can write N = (9*4k) + (18 + 5) = 9*(4k+2) + 5. So, when N is divided by 9, the remainder is 5." },
                    { question: "The price of sugar is increased by 25%. By what percent must a consumer reduce the consumption of sugar so that the expenditure on it remains unchanged?", options: ["15%", "20%", "25%", "30%"], answer: "20%", rationale: "Let original price = P, consumption = C. Expenditure = P*C. New price P' = 1.25P. New expenditure = P'*C' = P*C. 1.25P * C' = P*C => C' = C/1.25 = 0.8C. Reduction in consumption = C - 0.8C = 0.2C. Percentage reduction = (0.2C/C) * 100 = 20%." },
                    { question: "Find the fourth proportional to 4, 9, 12.", options: ["18", "21", "24", "27"], answer: "27", rationale: "Let the fourth proportional be x. Then 4:9 :: 12:x. Product of extremes = Product of means. 4 * x = 9 * 12. 4x = 108. x = 27." },
                    { question: "A and B start a business with investments of ₹10000 and ₹20000 respectively. After 6 months, C joins with ₹30000. Find the ratio of their profits at the end of the year.", options: ["2:4:3", "1:2:3", "2:4:5", "2:3:3"], answer: "2:4:3", rationale: "Profit ratio is based on (Investment * Time). A's share = 10000 * 12. B's share = 20000 * 12. C's share = 30000 * 6. Ratio = (10*12) : (20*12) : (30*6) = 120 : 240 : 180. Divide by 60 -> 2:4:3." },
                    { question: "The area of a circle inscribed in a square of side 14 cm is:", options: ["154 cm²", "184 cm²", "196 cm²", "204 cm²"], answer: "154 cm²", rationale: "The diameter of the inscribed circle is equal to the side of the square. Diameter = 14 cm, so Radius = 7 cm. Area of circle = πr² = (22/7) * 7 * 7 = 154 cm²." },
                    { question: "A batsman scores 87 runs in the 17th inning and thus increases his average by 3.

From 'D is the brother of B', B's gender is not explicitly stated. However, in such puzzles, if a gender allows for an option, it's often implied.
